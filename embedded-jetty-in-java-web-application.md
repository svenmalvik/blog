## Embedding Jetty Server in a Java Web Application

In the world of microservices and container technologies, we need Java applications to start as standalone units rather than within heavy application servers. This post will show how to embed the Jetty Server within a Java application. It will load a war file that is part of the project and that lives as a maven sub-modul.

The following tutorial is a more of a transcript of my video “...”. 

* Create a maven project.
* Create a maven module for the server.
* Add a servlet.
* Create a maven module for the web application that build the war file.
* Add webapp (.war) support into the server modul.
